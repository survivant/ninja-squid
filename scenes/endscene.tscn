I hope you had as much fun playing it as I did making it.

For reference, it was made for the Dragon Jam in 
less than 72 hours and all the assets are original.

However, I did have the support of the 
Godot Engine community and multiple code 
snippets used here are from them.



to all, thank you very much.
