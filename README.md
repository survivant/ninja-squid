NINJA SQUID

![ninja squid gameplay](https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTc0NDc0LzgxNDEyMy5naWY=/original/dhAbpM.gif)

A simple platformer made in Godot Engine for the GameDevNetwork: Dragon Jam

It uses an random dungeon generator by M. Henderson (https://bitbucket.org/signalsin/) to produce random levels as well as the random paralax background. The background is also blured using the blur shader from the Godot Demo Projects (https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects). The music was also randomly generated but in an offline manner.
